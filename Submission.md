# The project
My project is a civilisation simulation, before the game starts a variable can be edited on the FieldArea Gaemobject, the variable is called expansion and it controls a few different things within the game. The lower the expansion value, the less wide each city expands but the taller they expand. If the expansion value is lower more small cities will be made whereas if it is high there willl only be a few large cities. Once the project starts, after the player clicks on the screen an initial city is created. It will begin to branch out sending small objects to new building locations and creating buildings there, once enough buildings have been created new cities start to get created in the distance. You can press space to switch between 3 different cameras when playing, the first is a top down view, the second is a free hand view where you can look around and the third is a rotating view.

# What I did
I made most of what I had worked on by myself. I referred to the class work to help me with raycasting for the initial city to be placed and for the circular motion used by one of the cameras.

# What I am most proud of
I am most proud of creating a rule based system that works better than I expected as well as being able to make it visually interesting
