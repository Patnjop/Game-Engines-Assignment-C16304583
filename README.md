# Game Engines Assignment C16304583
## Civilisation generation
I plan to create a scene that begins with an unpopulated floodplains, after time the area will become populated and life will begin to thrive until it reaches it's climax in the form of a neon coloured urban area. I intend to use initial randomisation followed by a sequence of rules to guide the progression of the simulation. I have taken inspiration from the world's most popular cellular automaton Conway's Game of Life, as well as games that utilise a specific set of rules to determine how certain parts interact with eachother like Dwarf Fortress.

## Implementation
For the visuals I intend to follow an uncomplicated yet abstract style that is visually stimulating, my intention is to have several pre-built situations that if the circumstances are met cause exciting or impressive visuals. I will use a grid based system so that I can easily reference other grids, I will also be instantiating the buildings using several controller blocks.
